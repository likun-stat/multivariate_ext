# Flexible modeling of multivariate extremes with Bayesian networks
## Ongoing research by Shalini Mahanthege and Likun Zhang

When extremal behavior is observed in environmental and financial processes, it is usually observed in multiple processes simultaneously. Although past and current work discusses modeling such multivariate extremal dependence, they mostly focused on the limiting max-stable and generalized Pareto models that suffer inflexible dependence structure. In this work, we propose a scale mixture model of marginally transformed multivariate Gaussian distributions, where the scaling factors can be either heavy- or light-tailed, depending on parameters that are estimated from the data. We build in additional flexibility by incorporating a latent directed network structure in the scaling factors to represent causal relationships among different variables. The interplay between the scaling parameters and the directed graph permits smooth transitions between asymptotic dependence and asymptotic independence for any pair of components of the multivariate distribution. We build a standard adaptive Metropolis algorithm for model fitting and perform extensive simulation studies to validate its ability to infer important dependence parameters and the network adjacency matrix from data. Lastly, we apply the model to a multivariate dataset that include 500mb geopotential heights, air temperature and relative humidity to examine their joint tail behaviors during heatwave events.
